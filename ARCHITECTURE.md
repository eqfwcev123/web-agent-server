# AI-Powered Coding Algorithm Education Platform - System Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the system architecture for an AI-powered coding algorithm education platform built with NestJS. The platform focuses on providing exceptional UX for teaching coding algorithms through AI-powered explanations and interactive learning.

## Architecture Principles
- **Modular Design**: Each feature is encapsulated in its own module
- **Scalability**: Microservice-ready architecture with clear boundaries
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket support for interactive learning
- **AI Integration**: Flexible AI service integration for teaching capabilities
- **Code Safety**: Secure code execution environment
- **Performance**: Optimized for real-time AI responses and code execution

## Core Modules

### 1. Authentication & User Management (`/auth`, `/users`)
- JWT-based authentication
- User profiles with learning preferences
- Progress tracking and achievements
- Social authentication (Google, GitHub)

### 2. Problem Management (`/problems`)
- Algorithm problem parsing and storage
- Problem categorization (difficulty, topic, data structures)
- Test case management
- Problem templates and variations

### 3. AI Teaching Engine (`/ai-teaching`)
- Natural language processing of algorithm problems
- Step-by-step explanation generation
- Code analysis and improvement suggestions
- Personalized learning path recommendations
- Integration with multiple AI providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

### 4. Learning Sessions (`/learning-sessions`)
- Interactive learning session management
- Real-time progress tracking
- Hint system and guided learning
- Session replay and review capabilities

### 5. Code Execution Engine (`/code-execution`)
- Secure sandbox code execution
- Multiple language support (Python, JavaScript, Java, C++)
- Performance analysis and optimization suggestions
- Test case validation and feedback

### 6. Real-time Communication (`/websockets`)
- WebSocket gateway for real-time interactions
- Live coding assistance
- Progress notifications
- Collaborative learning features

## Database Design
